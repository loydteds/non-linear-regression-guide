            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>1. The Basics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Predicts a target variable based on a linear relationship with one or more predictor variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Linear Regression:</strong> Acknowledges that relationships between variables may not be linear, using more complex curves to capture patterns in the data.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>2. Key Non-Linear Regression Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Polynomial Regression:</strong> Fits a polynomial function to the data (e.g., y = a + bx + cxÂ²). Useful for capturing curvature and trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Predicts a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on predictor variables. Often used for classification problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spline Regression:</strong> Uses piecewise polynomial functions to model complex data. Allows for more flexibility and accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> Non-linear models inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing complex relationships between variables.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>3. Real-World Applications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Predicting Stock Prices:</strong>  Non-linear regression can capture the complex dynamics of financial markets, potentially outperforming linear models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyzing Customer Behavior:</strong>  Predicting customer churn or identifying customer segments based on their purchasing habits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modeling Disease Progression:</strong>  Understanding how factors like age, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition influence the development of diseases.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>4. When to Use Non-Linear Regression</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-linear relationships:</strong>  If your data suggests a curved relationship between variables, linear regression won't provide accurate predictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex patterns:</strong>  When the underlying relationship is highly non-linear or involves multiple interacting factors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better predictive power:</strong>  Non-linear models can often achieve higher accuracy compared to linear models.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>5. When NOT to Use Non-Linear Regression</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple linear relationships:</strong>  If the data exhibits a clear linear relationship, using a simpler linear model may suffice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited data:</strong>  Non-linear models require a sufficient amount of data to train effectively. With limited data, they might overfit the training set.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong>  Non-linear models can be more difficult to interpret compared to linear ones, making it harder to understand the influence of each predictor variable.</li>
                </ul>
